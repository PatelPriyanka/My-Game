Haxe Project 


In this project I used HaxeFlixel to perform different task.
This is 2 Player Game. 
1	Click on the “Play Now” button to start the game.

Rules of Game 
Here the game is about fighting (war) in which there are 2 players which will fight with each other to make their score. The will make their score by earning the star so I give the name of this game as “Star War”.

Both the player fights to earn the star. In other words, they want to make their score and win. The score is displayed on the upper side of the screen. The right-side score is for player 2 and the left side score is for player 1. Here both the player have gun and they can shoot each other. 

	Player cannot go beyond the wall.
	By default, both the player has score which is 50.
	When they collect one star, they will earn +10 points, which is added in their total score.
	If player encountered by bullet (opposite player bullet) then he will lose 50 points 
	If the score less than 0 means player die.
	If both the player touches each other than the game will over and no one will win.
	If any of the player have score more then or equal to 650 then he will win (if the player earns more than half star then he will win)
	By default both the player start their game from opposite side 
	The player will always fire on that direction where the appositive player is.
